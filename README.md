<p>This theme was made for my personal use in Visual Studio Code. Be free to use and edit if you want.</p>

<p> The theme name was inspired by Geralt's horse from The Witcher, just as the icon was inspired by The Witcher: Wild Hunt emblem, with some changes. I love the game series, the book collection and the new adaptation of netflix series, so was there were i take the ideas.<p>

**Enjoy!**
